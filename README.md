# Gitlab with less padding
Userstyle to make all the GitLab interface gaps less insane (and pretty dense, to be honest). Specially useful for small screens or if you resize your window often.
Not all views have been altered, only the most common ones. Also, I removed the `max-width`s so all pages can fill the entire browser window width.

Find the code inside `style.css`. Use with e.g. [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#stylus) and set the URL matching regexp to `https://gitlab\.com/.*` and `https?://gitlab\.[^.]+\..+` so that self-hosted instances are also matched (in most cases), like https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce.
